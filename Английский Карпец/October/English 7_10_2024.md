# Pictures
1. Landscape
	In the picture I can see a grass and a sky with some colour, like more cyan than blue. In my opinion, this picture have to be watched on the canvas, not in the course book, because scanning of work is not so great - we can't see the real difference between cyan and green (they are different parts of one color in color since)
2. Portrait
	In the picture I can see a portrait of a girl in the dark coat (Why does this work named a girl in crimson, if it seems like the black coat?). In my opinion, this portrait looks like it has shotten on the Nikon DSLR with high ISO by a beginner photographer.
3. Abstraction
	In the picture I can see a desert with the coffee table in the left third of image, this table stands on a chess board (like people should choose the next step) an this coffee table there are three glasses, also in this picture I can see a shadow of a kid, looking at the antelope. Maybe, three glasses is a symbol of unity of a people, animals (antelope) and nature (the dune in right top third of image).
