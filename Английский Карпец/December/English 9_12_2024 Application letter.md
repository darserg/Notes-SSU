Dear Sir or Madam,

I have just read your advertisement for people to appear in the 'Lion King'. I could join your show as photographer.

I am a 17-year-old student, studying in **Saratov State University**  CS&IT faculty. I am reliable and hardworking, also I'm a bit introvert. I love **photography**, **videography** and **coding**. In the university I'm a part of media community, so main my skill is to take photos and make fast correction to it - sometimes I can to send ready photos after a few hours after event, for example, once I shot 500 photos and send all good of them the next day.

**English is not the main my language**, but I now it as well, especially in some *professional environment*.

I would like to be involved in your show because I think, it would be great experience for me - to take some photos in your big show, and for you - to get some great photos of your show.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Yours faithfully,

Sergey Darin
