## **3. My Letter.**

Dear Jean Blake,  

I am writing to express my interest in joining the walking and climbing trip to the Himalayas, as advertised in the local newspaper. This opportunity sounds exciting, and I would love to be considered.  

I would like to ask about the exact dates of the trip. Could you also let me know if there is a minimum age requirement to join?  

Additionally, I would appreciate more information about the area the group will be visiting and what the conditions will be like. Could you also clarify if accommodation will be provided, and if so, what type?  

Thank you for your time and assistance. I look forward to hearing from you soon.  

Yours sincerely,  
Sergey
