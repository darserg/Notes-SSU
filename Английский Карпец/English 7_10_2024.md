# Task 1
1. Landscape
	In the picture I can see a grass. In my opinion, this picture is loosing colour even with complaining colours (cyan and green are different parts of one color (in computer color since)) 
2. Portrait
	In the picture I can see a portrait of a human in the dark coat (it's hard to describe him/her). In my opinion, this portrait was shoot on the Nikon DSLR with high ISO (like I have been shooting for 4 hours this Sunday)
3. Abstraction
	In the picture I can see a desert with the coffee table in the left third of image, this table stands on a chess board (like people should choose the next step) an this coffee table there are three glasses, also in this picture I can see a shadow of a kid, looking at the antelope. Maybe, three glasses is a symbol of unity of a people, animals (antelope) and nature (the dune in right top third of image).
